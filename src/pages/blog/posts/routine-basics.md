Refactoring is the process in programming by which you improve upon your already existing code. Over the next couple of weeks, I will be exploring ways in which you could begin to apply this coding practice to your personal life, improving upon that which may already exist. 

This first week I take a look at the basics of building/maintaining a routine. Whether you realize it or not, each one of us has a routine and our lives are built around them. They can range anywhere from sleeping in until noon and playing video games until its time for bed again to waking up before 6 and hitting the gym or going on a morning run before work. Routines, good or bad, affect our daily lives, which is more than enough reason to take a closer look at refactoring yours.

## Getting Started
If you are the type of person who is looking to improve their life in any sort of measurable way then getting started with a routine that works for you, and more importantly, one you can stick with, is probably the best place to start. Routines come in all shapes and sizes. From what you do the first 30 minutes after you wake up to your entire workday routine. In order to make truly lasting change we will take a look at the #1 mistake that people make when attempting to implement change.

### Too Fast Too Furious

Not only is this a great film franchise, it is also one of the most common downfalls for those trying to enact change in a meaningful way. This is especially evident at the start of a new year, when many of us re-evaluate all the things we are doing wrong in our lives and proceed to fix ALL of them at once beginning on the first of the month. 

This might not work for a multitude of reasons, but who knows, maybe it did for you. Are you still going to the gym three times a week like you said you would? If yes, then congrats, keep it up! If not, read on.

Getting started with building and sticking to a routine comes down to 3 main things:
1. Forming Habits
2. Building a System
3. Self-Evaluation

### Forming Habits

Routines are essentially a chain of habits that you do in a specific sequence. Thus, one of the main keys to this whole thing comes down to simply learning how to effectively form new habits and how to maintain/adjust them. The easiest way to accomplish this is to start off with SMALL. ACTIONABLE. STEPS. Something that requires little to no effort to think about and when completed activates a chain reaction of events which lead to the thing you want to accomplish. Confused? Here's an example:

Say you want you get in to the habit of going to the gym..logistics aside (gym membership, how you are going to get there, etc.) we want to break this habit down to the first smallest, most actionable step achievable, and that is...changing in to your gym clothes. Lay them out the day before or change in to them immediately upon waking up and you will notice a distinct difference in just how you feel towards your ultimate goal of making it to the gym and working out, as opposed to feeling overwhelmed about the entirety of it all. Changing your clothes is easy. Getting them ready the night before makes it easier, and wearing them to sleep requires no effort at all. Once you are changed, you will find the next steps start falling in to place. From there you can get in to your car and drive to the gym. The biggest thing is by taking that first step and making it easier and easier to accomplish, we reduce the activation energy required for the whole sequence of events to get started.

Here are some more quick examples:

Not a gym goer and just want to read more? Start off with a timer (the clock app on your phone should have one), set it to 10 minutes, and grab your book. Then, simply read until the timer goes off. Chip away at pages like this and you'll be burning through books in no time.

Weak and illiterate? Perhaps you simply want to lose weight by eating better! The first step we can take here is not some strict diet, but rather, meticulously tracking what goes in to our bodies. Download an app (I use MyFitnessPal personally) or simply read off the nutritional labels on most packaged goods, then take note of how many calories you end up with at the end of the day. Over time, if you are taking in less calories than you expend throughout the day, then I can almost guarantee you will see results.

### Build a System: Discipline v Motivation

You might be wondering at this point..but I've tried all of this! I've tried tracking, I've tried reading a page a day, etc. and it just didn't work. To that I say, check your system. Are you holding yourself accountable to the progress you say your making? Are you relying purely on the motivation that comes at the end of the week, which fades the following Monday? Even the most disciplined, motivated individuals just don't have the willpower some days, and that is okay (I will get to rest in a minute). By simply setting up systems around the habits and routines we are trying to stick with or building our habits into our already existing systems, we eliminate the need for discipline and motivation entirely. These systems become a part of who we are and thus, second nature. 

A system is a set of actions that we take almost unconsciously. Similar in a way to routines, yet on a smaller scale. When you wake up, you go through your morning system, which at this point might be unknowingly reaching out to your phone to check your notifications. Or you may have a bathroom system, in which you always brush your teeth and then reach for the soap to wash your face. You don't think about these actions, they are just built-in associations you have. That is the ultimate goal with what we are trying to do with our habits and routines. How we incorporate new habits into existing systems might be difficult at first, but once we have them set up we are ready to take that next step.

### Self Evaluation

Lastly, we want to be continuously evaluating our routines! There is no one set and forget routine. People change. We evolve over time and so will our daily habits and routines evolve with us. The system you set as a college freshman with their first class at 11am is going to look entirely different from the system you have if you start to work a 9-5 job. By constantly taking a look at where we are in our lives and where it is we want to go. We can see how our habits can get us closer to that point and adjust what it is we do each day so we are constantly working towards our goals. 

## Routine Upkeep

The hardest part is over right? We didn't have a great routine, or any good habits at first, but now we do! So, job done, right? Wrong! There is now this little issue of keeping up with them. Upkeep may make it seem like a chore that we will eventually not want to take care of any more, but here are some ways which we can avoid that.

### Rest Day(s)

Rest is vitally important, not just for our physical wellbeing, but for our mental wellbeing as well. It allows us to recharge. This is where the bulk of new learning takes place, and how our muscles repair and grow after an intense workout. It is also how we stay afloat in the ever raging sea of productivity. Often times we feel that we need to do it all. At once. By yesterday. That is simply not the case. While there is an admiration to be had for those out there grinding 24/7, the vast majority of us are just not cut out for that much stress and pressure. By taking rest periods in between all the 5 AM wake ups, gym workouts and healthy eating, we are allowing ourselves the mental and physical rest we need to keep up with our routines and ensure their longevity. 

### Avoid two day spirals

The problem with rest days, is that for some, they turn in to weeks, which turn in to months, which may lead in to you just giving up entirely. Let's try to avoid that shall we? A great way to avoid these spirals is not by trying to pretend they don't exist and working hard to prevent them, but by acknowledging that they can occur and doing our best to avoid that second or third day from happening. Missing the gym once, can quickly turn in to missing it for 3 days thanks to the arrival of the weekend, which can turn in to missing all of next week because we feel lethargic since we missed the gym and it spirals from there. If you miss once, the key is to not beat yourself up about it. Recognize that now you must avoid the two day spiral, and maybe go on the weekend to prevent your system from decaying.

### Outlook: I can't v I don't

Our outlook on things is the last stop on the routine upkeep train. The difference between telling yourself you can't do something (an action) versus you telling yourself that you don't do something (a trait) is huge! It is a much smaller mental hurdle to overcome when we tell ourselves that what we are doing is simply a bad action, as opposed to, telling ourselves that what we are doing goes against the very nature of who we are. 

## Conclusion

This week we've looked at how to get started with our routines and perhaps change the ones we already have in place. Routines are the building blocks with which we can use towards becoming a better version of ourselves. They allow us to take the willpower out of things we know we should be doing and focuses on incorporating them in to who we are each day. They also are flexible enough to change as we do and allow us to grow as individuals without losing what we set out to achieve with them in the first place; structure in our lives.

## TL;DR

Start off small by creating habits through the smallest, most actionable step you can take, that requires little to no effort.

Build a system by which you can eliminate the need for discipline or motivation.

Re-evaluate your routines and habits regularly.

Maintain your routine by remembering to take rest days.

Avoid unwanted spirals by acknowledging them then cutting them out before they get out of control.

Change your outlook from action focused to character focused when it comes to your decision-making.
