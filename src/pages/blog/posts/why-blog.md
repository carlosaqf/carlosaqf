## So, why blog?

My decision to start a blog, a consistent blog at that, comes down to 5 main reasons. 
1. It will act as an outlet for me to extract whatever I am thinking from my brain on to a page. 
2. It will help to create a timeline of my frame of mind as I continue to learn and grow as a person. 
3. Writing on a consistent basis will serve to improve my writing ability.
4. This blog will encourage my growth creatively as I explore new ways of expressing ideas in a concrete and written fashion.
5. Lastly, it will help to solidify new concepts that I am learning about by explaining them as simply as I can to those who might be unfamiliar, in ways that they can (hopefully) understand.

Let's take a look at each of these a bit closer, shall we?

### Brain Dump

It is safe to say that starting out, this blog will primarily consist of pure nonsense. There won't be a specific theme or 'vibe' to the things I write about and that is by design. The main function of this blog is to act as a brain dump. A central place for me to gather my thoughts on a subject (any subject I find interesting really) and purge them on to a page.

Throughout the week, I will take things that are on my mind, organize them in way that will make sense, then pick the thing I find most interesting and write about it. This will hopefully allow me to think about things deeply and then empty my headspace to make room for something else.   


### Time Machine

If you have ever kept a journal (which I have been doing for the past several years, and highly encourage everyone to do as well), you should know that the recording of information as it is happening to us in the present, is always an interesting thing to reflect upon in the future. It provides us a way to 'go back in time' and experience what we were thinking and feeling at a certain point in our lives and relive the memories all over again. It gives us hope by showing us that, perhaps, that really bad thing that happened 2 years ago, which definitely felt like the end of the world at that time, wasn't and that we have grown from our experiences and they have made us who we are today. 

That is the second point of this blog. To show myself (and anyone else who will decide to read these posts) just how far I have come and what exactly I was doing and thinking at certain points in time.

### Write More Better

Improving in anything you do does not just take time, it takes repetition as well. It is the combination of doing something many, many times over the course of a long period that we begin to see habits form and progress made. It is my hope that this blog will provide both of those things which I can then apply towards my writing. The ability to convey ideas and express oneself through text, in both a professional and personal capacity, is extremely crucial, especially in our current 'texting' era. 

With prevalent social media applications, such as Twitter and Facebook, enforcing a cap on the number of characters, but at the same time encouraging consistent engagement, we begin to cut corners with our writing. Replacing thoughts with emojis and providing feedback with a simple 'lol'. You have probably noticed some overlap in your professional capacity as well, if at some point you have felt the urge to respond (or perhaps even did) to a work email with a 'lol'. My goal is to treat this blog as a way of 'putting in the reps' towards writing and begin to not only form the habit, but improve upon it as well.

### Creating Creativity

As with my attempts to use this blog to become a better writer, it will also work to increase my creativity. There are only so many ways I can say 'I think that' or 'I feel' before the monotony sets in and everybody reading this blog (myself included) grows too bored and loses interest. It is a challenge in and of itself to create a blog engaging enough to capture the audience's attention and keep them reading and coming back for those out there who may actually be writers and have years of experience. Although my goal for this is not to grow massively, I would still like to be captivating enough to have people take a look at what I write and feel engaged with my words.

### Rubber Duck Debugging

Lastly, this blog will act as my 'rubber duck'. For those unfamiliar with the phrase, 'Rubber Duck Debugging' refers to the method in software development, of explaining your code line-by-line, to an actual rubber duck (or various inanimate object) in the hopes that you will come across the solution to your problem in the process. In this case, you (the audience) will act as my rubber duck, as I go through the process of learning new and interesting things. Explaining concepts in such a way that would make sense to someone with no knowledge or background in the field can provide us (me) with a deeper understanding of the topics we are trying to learn. 

If you have nieces or nephews below the age of 8 you have probably experienced this yourself at one point or another when you find yourself bombarded with questions and the dreaded follow up of 'why'. The response to your explanation, being again, 'why'. After a couple of 'whys' you can begin to see where the gaps in your knowledge lie and realize that you might not have known as much as you thought you did on the topic in the first place.

## Who is this even for?

If you have read up until this point, then first off, congratulations, and secondly, you may have begun to wonder; if this blog is mainly to help yourself, then who is it even for? The answer, I'm afraid, is exactly that. Myself. I am starting off this blog with specific goals and any unintended consequences, such as, building a readership, getting views, etc., would simply be a delightful bonus. I do hope, however, that if by some miracle you come across this blog and find yourself reading a post or two of my writing, that you can take away something from reading what I have written and gain from my collective experiences that I amassed over my nearly 25 years of living (which when typing it out doesn't really feel like a whole lot, but you can make of it what you will).


### Go on...
So let's just say you do decide to continue reading. Why should you even entertain anything that I have to say? Who am I to explain things to you? To which I would reply, that you shouldn't and I am no one of importance. I am not a professional writer with a New York Times bestseller. I am not some famous CEO of a tech start up writing about 'productivity hacks' that made me the man I am today. I am not a prodigy or life coach or anyone you would normally seek advice from. I am just a 24-year old male, originally from the island of Guam who now lives in Chicago working in IT. I live what I consider to be a normal life. I work out, have hobbies that I enjoy, drink beer (sometimes too much at once), read books, socialize with colleagues and friends and I am going through the process of becoming the best person that I can be. Oddly enough, it is for those exact reasons that I feel someone would and should continue to read what I write. I am no one, which is basically everyone (or a decent amount of people). I am just like you. Although I am not in college anymore, I still learn new things on a daily basis. I (very recently) went through the job hunting process. I am not 'special' in the sense of belonging to the 1% of people who are typically worthy of reading. I am not someone who has 'been there' talking about what worked for me. I am there now and I am trying things that may or may not work for me, but could potentially work for you. Who knows? Join me, and let's fail and grow together.

## Future Plans

With the why's and who's out of the way I can begin to answer the questions of 'what' and 'when'. In terms of what you can expect from future posts, as stated above, it really can be anything. Anything I find the least bit interesting, anything I am currently learning about and want to share, or anything that I feel the need to talk about or discuss with you, my rubber duck. It may be a new piece of technology (hardware or software) that I have been using lately. It might be some tips on ways to be more productive (as if there weren't already enough of these). It may be a book review on something I have read recently. The possibilities are endless! I'm going with the 'throw a bunch of the stuff at the wall and see what sticks' approach here. 

As far as 'when' I'll be posting, the plan is to review and research a topic throughout the week, write up a draft and put something out by Sunday afternoon. Every week being the initial goal, but with every other week being the more realistic outcome. I might also look in to crossposting a few articles over on [reddit](www.reddit.com) depending on if it relates to the subreddits I frequent and if I feel like they would be contributing. I probably won't publicize my blog just yet on there, but if people ask for more then I might point them in the right direction...
